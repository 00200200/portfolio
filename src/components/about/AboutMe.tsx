				<p>
					I am a student of Computer Engineering at Wroclaw University Of Science and Technology. I started my journey
					with programming in 2021, creating websites in JavaScript. While preparing for my high school exams I learned
					Python, at University I was introduced to C/C++, Java and Assembler.
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					As I explored various fields within programming, I developed a particular interest in machine learning and
					artificial intelligence.
					<br></br>
					<br></br>I would very much like to develop my skills by working on real projects. With my passion for
					programming, I am confident that I will be a great fit for your team.
